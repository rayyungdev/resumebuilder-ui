# resumebuilder-ui
Creating a resume builder ui with React. 

Main Concept:  
- Previously, I built a resume builder that can create resumes from the terminal. It didn't have a user interface. This project is meant to rectify that. 

Project Layout: 
  - First iteration and features : 
    - Uses my previous original yaml file
    - Able to download the resume
    - Create forms: 
       - Search Tags
       - Name File
  - Architecture 
    - Front-end : React /Javascript
    - Serverless (Avoid trying to set up another VM) 
       - Try to learn AWS Lambda
